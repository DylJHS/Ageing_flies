RNA‑seq chromatin‑state ageing analysis

RNA‑seq read counts for intestinal stem cells from Drosophila melanogaster were obtained from GEO (GSE157794), covering 7 young, 3 middle‑aged, 3 old and 3 geriatric flies. Genes with fewer than two total reads were excluded, and differential expression was assessed using DESeq2 with contrasts for each older group against young. Genes with adjusted P ≤ 0.1 were considered significant. Chromatin states were defined using ISC_chromatin_states.updt.bed (Josserand et al.), and each gene was assigned a predominant state based on the largest coverage across its gene body (FlyBase r6.48), using GenomicRanges and fuzzyjoin. For each age contrast, significantly up- and down-regulated genes were counted within each chromatin category. Visualisations included plots summarising gene expression changes per chromatin state.
