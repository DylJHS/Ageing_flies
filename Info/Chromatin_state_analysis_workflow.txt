Workflow 2

1. Prepare Annotations
- Load the Drosophila gene annotation file (GFF/GTF) into R as a GRanges object. (from flybase release 6)
- Import the chromatin state BED file as a GRanges object.

2. Map Chromatin States to Genes
- Use overlap functions to associate BED regions with genes.
- Assign chromatin state labels to genes based on overlapping regions.
- Chose to ignore the strand (the tracks dataset only contain "+")

3. Load Expression Data
- Read expression TSV files, ensuring gene identifiers match the annotation.
- Combine data into a matrix with genes as rows and samples as columns.
- Associate the genes in the expression data with the tracks

4. Define Sample Information
- Create a metadata frame with sample names and age groups (young, middle-aged, old, very old).


6. Perform Differential Expression Analysis
- Use Deseq2
- Run with contrasts (young-old, young-mid, ...)
- Identify significantly differentially expressed genes based on statistical thresholds.
- Create the volcano plots

7. Summarise Expression Changes
- Identify up- and down-regulated genes for each comparison.
- Link differentially expressed genes to their chromatin state labels.

8. Generate Output and Reports
- Produce summary tables showing up/down-regulated genes overall and by chromatin state.
- Visualise results using bar charts
