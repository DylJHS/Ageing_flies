- Continued with the pipeline looking at the methods to do pseudbulk gene expression analysis using the samples in the data 
- The process involves looping over the cell types, looping over the individual samples, aggregating the replicate counts for each sample
- Found that the data does not contain the raw counts  but only the log transformed data
- Will need ot use the FASTQ/A files from each of the samples in order to regain the reads and then construct the data from there
- Or run a scDGE analysis that does not pseudobulk the data but is also less robust than the pseudobulk methods

26/03/25

- Going to run the analysis using scDGE methods. After the results are in I'll ask if they would like a more thourough look at the genes/cells using pseudobulk methods

27/03/25 
- Tried runnign DGEA with scanpy diffxpy but the tests were not successful
- Running the analysis using Seurat instead of scanpy with python for better
- Converting the data to seurat accessible forma
- Verified that the "ncount_originalexp" were not the actual real counts that could not be seen in the original data with scanpy/anndata

30/03/25
- Runngin teh DGEA with Seruat and MAST
- Ran on a test run with single cell type and between male_5 and male_70 using the batch as a latent variable 
- Need to rerun using the iteration over the cell types and with pairwise comparison between (female_5 and male_5) (see Chatgpt)
- When iterative running need to make sure to re-adjust the raw p_values (not the adj_pvalues) once all the iterations are complete with the BH correction

31/03/25
- Ran the DGE (afca_analysis_310325_v2.R) using Seurat and MAST with both the batch (sample) and the sex as latent factors
- Creating a unique plot for each cell type
- Need to write the volcano plot script
- Want to color by age_comp and label the gene names 

01/04/25
- Plotting the graphs 
- Shows not much significance in teh selected genes being differentially expressed
- Could be due to the number of unique samples (flies) per cell type or age_comparison or the total number of subsamples
- Need to write up the report and load it in teh elab

02/04/25
- Looking at the results in more detail
- aggregatingby cell type and comparison and assessing joint feautures (n_cells, cell differentials, sample differentials, sex ratio differentials, n_sigificant, pct_signif) 

03/04/25
- Getting a detialed look at the correlations between the aggregated metrics and the cell types/comparisons
- Did not show anything of too much value
- Started formal report

04/04/25
- Continued formal report
- looking at the non-numerical categories (cell_type, comparison)
- trying to assess associations with the p-val/FC

07/04/25 
- Finishing formal report
- Still waiting on the reponse from the Lab 

08/04/25
- Reading up on using the nf-core rnaseq pipeline to go from the raw fastq files to the tsv gene count files
- Reading up on the data formats from the afca data 
- Found the CellRanger data at https://zenodo.org/records/7853649
- Downloading the cellranger data to the hpc 

09/04/25
- Processing the CellRanger data
- Extracting the desired samples (Raw Filtered Body) to h5ad files
- Concatenating the individual files to one file (trying to) 

10/04/25 
- Concatenated the files into one big one
- trying to analyse the data

11/04/25
- Analysing the raw filtered CellRanger data 
- The data lacks annotations for cell type 
- Has the barcodes which am linking to the cell types using the full normalised dataset

15/04/25
- The cell ranger data does not contain the 5 day old fly samples as the data is only from the AFCA and not the FCA
- Will have to use the data from both datasets and integrate them 
- The age and the batch effects are confounded completely
- They use ML and clustering in order to transfer the annotations from the FCA to the AFCA samples in order to correct for batch effects
- Will rerun the DGEA using the the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test

16/04/25
- Ran the statistical DGEA using the wilcoxon Rank Sum test instead of MAST
- Differences weren't too differentially

17/04/25
- Rerunning the test but using the BH correction as opposed to the Bonferroni correction which is too strict
- Got better results than with the BF correction 
- Will rerun using the full data and subsetting by cell type
- Might also reprocess the data in a cell-type-specific manner to yield more accurate results

18/04/25
- Reading up on pre-processing the data in a cell-type specific manner 
- Will apply a minimum gene expression based on expression in a minimum number of cells

20/04/25
- Looking at the shape of the subset data
- Would ideally like to analyse cell types with > 100 cells for each of the 3 age brackets

22/04/25
- Subsetted the data based on the number of cells total and by age group
- Cell type needs to have at least 100 cells in each age group for the different age groups in teh cell type
- Created the subset 
- Downloaded it 
- Filtering the genes based on expression in at least 3 cells\
- File too large to process on local machine
- Made ct specific files 
- Editing the afca_analysis RMD script to handle the multiple files

23/04/25
- Edited the script and running it in hpc due to the number fo comparisons and tests 

24/04/25
- Running the scripts in parallel
- Got all the results for all the cell types

25/04/25
- Forgot to filter the genes to exclude non-expressed genes
- Fitlering out the genes that are lowly expressed but which are not part of the gene list of interest ("Su(var)205","Su(var)3-9","G9a", "HP1b", "HP1c", "HP4", "HP5", "HP6", "ADD1", "Su(var)2-HP2", "Su(var)3-7", "Lam", "LamC", "LBR", "Kdm4A", "Kdm4B", "His2Av", "His3.3A", "His3.3B")
- Generated the figures which showed better results 
- Re-ran with the MAST function to account for batch/sample effects

27/04/25
- Transfered the files to /data/projects/Janssen/redox_chromatin/dhaynessimmons/data_analysis/ageing_flies/Results/afca_analysis/afca_scdgea_v2/ct_specific_MAST
on the projects server

28/04/25
- Generated the volcano plots for the MAST results
